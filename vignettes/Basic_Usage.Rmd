## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
cars
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r cont-plot}
ggplot(data = cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist, color = dist)) + geom_point() + themeBayer::scale_color_bayer_c(name = 'purple_green') + theme_minimal()
```

## Discrete colors

```{r disc-plot}
## example uses very handy ggridges package

ggplot(data = iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Species, fill = Species)) + ggridges::geom_density_ridges(color = 'white', alpha = .4) + themeBayer::scale_fill_bayer_d(name = 'lights', direction = -1) + theme_minimal()

## direction < 0 gives colors in reverse order
```
