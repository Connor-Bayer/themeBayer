# Bayer `RMarkdown` Template

This template is meant to serve as a simple way to get nice-looking `.Rmd` documents that are somewhat related to the Bayer theme.

## Some Useful Tips

- If you would like to change the logo image to something else, replace `logo.jpg` with a different file.
- To add latex packages to the file so they can be used in knitting, add a line underneath `fancyhdr: null` in the YAML header. More information on including Latex packages in this way can be seen in [the RMarkdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-extra.html#loading-latex-packages).
